Core Library Usage
------------------

To use this library first unzip to a directory on your computer.

Then in Visual Studio select Add a Reference and use the Browse tab to find the directory where you unzipped the archive.
In this directory you will find a directory named Core which contains several different builds of the library depending
on your target platform.  Note that the build is always called dotNetRDF.dll as this gives optimum compatibility with
package management systems like NuGet.

Please see ReadMe.txt for a complete listing of available builds of the core library

dotNetRDF includes intellisense for all classes providing that the relevant XML documentation file from the appropriate build
is located in the same directory as the DLL file.

To use classes from the library it is generally easiest to import the namespaces you need eg.

C#
using VDS.RDF;

VB
Imports VDS.RDF

Please see the API documentation at http://bitbucket.org/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf/wiki for further details on Namespaces,
Classes, Methods etc

Plugin Library Usage
--------------------

This package also contains several plugin libraries which provide additional optional features.

There are data providers found under the Data directory that can be used to access specific storage backends in conjunction
with the dotNetRDF API.  These are as follows:

- OpenLink Virtuoso -> dotNetRDF.Data.Virtuoso.dll

There is a single query plugin found under the Query directory that provides full text query support using Lucene.Net:

- Full Text Query -> dotNetRDF.Query.FullText.dll

Please see ReadMe.txt for a complete listing of available builds of these plugin libraries.

Note: Whichever of these plugin libraries you use you should also include the dependencies of that library to ensure it functions correctly.
Dependencies for each library can be found in the directory with the build.

Requirements
------------

We recommend using NuGet to install dotNetRDF libraries since that will manage depdendencies for you.

To use this library you will need .Net Framework 3.5 SP1 or higher.

The Core Library depends on the following third party libraries:
- JSON.Net 6.0.3 which can be obtained from http://json.codeplex.com
- HtmlAgilityPack 1.4.6 which can be obtained from http://www.codeplex.com/htmlagilitypack (Not required if using the PCL build)
- VDS.Common 1.3.0 which can be obtained form http://bitbucket.org/rvesse/vds-common
- Portable.Runtime 0.1.0 which can be obtained from http://pclcontrib.codeplex.com (Only required if using the PCL build)

The relevant DLLs are included with this release and if you wish to use the library you may need to reference these
DLLs as well to ensure it is available in your project for dotNetRDF to use.

To use any of the other libraries you must include the appropriate version of the Core library and its dependencies

If you wish to use the optional Data.Virtuoso library that is also included you will need the additional
OpenLink Virtuoso ADO.Net provider which can be found in the folder with the Data.Virtuoso library

If you wish to use the optional Query.FullText library that is also included you will need the additional
Lucene.Net library which can be found in the folder with the Query.FullText library

Known Issues
------------

We are aware of the following issues with the library.  Please remember that this is an Beta release and so
there are things that may be buggy still and the API is subject to change at our discretion or based upon
user feedback.

NuGet
- There is a requirement for Silverlight/Windows Phone projects using this library to reference
  System.Xml.XPath because it is required by HtmlAgilityPack which cannot be handled automatically by
  NuGet at this time
- Portable Class Library users may need to add additional PCLContrib dependencies for their target profiles
  manually since these are not yet available via NuGet

Parsing
- RDFa 1.1 support does not currently meet the latest version of the specification
- TriG support does not yet match the RDF 1.1 specification (Feb 25th 2014)
 
Query and Update
- Queries and Updates are not always thread safe - see User Guide for details on how to guarantee this
